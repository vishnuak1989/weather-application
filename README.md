A simple weather application that fetches current weather of the city.<br/>

<<<<<<< HEAD
__Regarding the API keys. I have hidden my API Keys. So when you get the API key All you have to do is create a file keys_config.js inside the 'src' folder.<br />Then add the following code to your keys_config.js file <br />
```javascript
const API_K = "Your API Key from Openweather map";
export default  API_K;
```
